# 🎄 Advent-of-Code 🎅

## Introduction
Advent of Code ([link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This repository contains the solutions to AoC 2021 and 2022 problems in Python 3.10.

In total I have currently 86 ⭐. I completed the AoC 2021. In this repo you will find the 2021 solutions inside a jupyter notebook and the ones for the 2022 in python script.

## Installation

Create the environment from the environment.
yml file inside the specific year folder:

```bash
> cd <year> # cd 2022
> conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

To run a single solution:

```bash
> conda activate AoC # Activate conda environment
```

```bash
> python3 src/<DAY>.py
```

At the end is created a `log` file inside the `<year>` folder. It will contains all solution with both part 1 and 2 and the elapsed time for each day.

It is also possible to run all days within a year using. 

```bash
> python3 run_all.py
```
