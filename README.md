# üéÑ Advent-of-Code üéÖ

## Introduction
Advent of Code ([link](https://adventofcode.com/2022/about)) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This repository contains the solutions to AoC 2021 and 2022 problems in Python 3.10.

In total I have currently 78 ‚≠ê. I completed the AoC 2021. In this repo you will find the 2021 solutions inside a jupyter notebook and the ones for the 2022 in python script.

## Installation

Create the environment from the environment.
yml file:

```bash
> conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Usage

Move to the `2022` folder. To run a single solution:

```bash
> python3 src/<DAY>.py
```

At the end is created a `log` file inside the `2022` folder. It will contains all solution with both part 1 and 2 and the elapsed time for each day.
